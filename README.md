## Outline

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
This script is a Node.js CLI parser designed to handle command-line arguments with special handling for sub-commands and escape sequences. It allows for flexible argument parsing, including flags, commands,
and paths.

1. Shebang and Setup

Script is executable as a Node.js CLI.

2. Configuration

Defines escapeSequences (e.g., exec) and escapeTerminator (e.g., ;, \;) for special argument handling.

3. Argument Parsing Helpers

- `printHelp()`: Prints usage instructions and available options.

- `normalizeKey(flag)`: Converts flags like -my-flag to myFlag.

- `parseValue(val)`: Converts "true"/"false" to booleans, numeric strings to numbers, otherwise returns the
  string.

4. `parseArgs`: Main Argument Parser

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
Iterates through command-line arguments: If -h or --help is found, prints help and exits. The first argument is treated as the command. The first non-flag after the command is treated as the path. Handles flags in the form `-key=value` or `--key=value`. Handles flags in the form `-key value`. If the flag is in escapeSequences (like
`exec`), collects all following arguments until a terminator (`;` or `\;`), and stores them as a single string.

- Boolean flags (e.g., `-flag`) are set to `true`. Ignores any other positional arguments.

## Triage

### Includes:

- Error Handlers
- Cleanup
- Main execution

### Overview:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
If no arguments are provided, prints help and exits with error. Parses arguments using `parseArgs`. If no command is found, prints an error and help, then exits. Prints the parsed result as formatted JSON. This script is a flexible CLI argument parser with special handling for sub-commands like `-exec` ... `;`, and is easy to extend for more escape sequences or options.
